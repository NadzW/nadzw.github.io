Hi! I'm **Nadeem** -- game designer and modder. I spend my time reverse engineering games, attempting to make fixes 
and adding new features that I would personally want to see and use. In the gaming universe, I go by **Nadz** or 
**Shalashaska**.

A game design graduate specializing in TECHNICAL DESIGN and SYSTEMS DESIGN. I develop modular systems, HUD/UI backend 
and exciting levels. I'm passionate about technical problem-solving and designing unique experiences. 

I started creating games in 2015, exploring different engines like 
[game maker studio](https://gamemaker.io/en) and 
[rpg maker mv](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mv), making stories and games inspired by childhood
favourites like Zelda, Final Fantasy and Pokemon. 

I've always been drawn to creating my own content and levels which eventually pulled me to creating mods for games
I liked through the use of user generated tools and industry standard software.

In my spare time, I enjoy keeping active with hiking and weight lifting, reading and mostly playing games on my PC.
I have also recently taken an interest in learning new languages (currently mandarin) and want to start learning how
to play the Keyboard.

### What I Do:

systems.  

- Game and Quest Design - Designing interesting and unique levels and experiences. 

- Unreal Engine Expertise â€“ Proficient in Blueprint scripting and C++, with experience in customisation systems,

Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute to innovative game projects, particularly in 
racing/driving games, action/story games and any general systemic design.
