summary: >
  <p>This is my latest project and final university project and is something I am currently working on. It is a modular vehicle customisation system 
  that handles aero mesh swaps, vehicle recolouring, adding decals (with an editor) and wheel swaps. This was started as a
  university project but is being further developed to work in a side project.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In this same project, I also made an editor extension plugin that would automatically create decals and append the 
  decals datatables to register them as decals and make them usable within the game.</p>
