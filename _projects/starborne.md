summary: >
  <p>Another game jam I took part in as part of a team. Starborne was created for GBJam 11 from Sept 15 - Sept 25, 2023.
  This space-themed multidirectional bullet hell took inspiration from classic games like Asteroids and Space Duel.  </p>

  <p>This time I took more of a gameplay programmers role and only supported our designer with some decisions and 
  feedback on features and gameplay. This gave me an opportunity to work on my c# and programming skills. </p>
responsibilities:
  - Putting team together and maintaining good communication
  - Working close with the designer to bring their ideas to life with the game code
  - Working with the graphics and sound artists to bring their assets into the game
