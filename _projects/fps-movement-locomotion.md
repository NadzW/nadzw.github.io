title: "FPS Movement Locomotion"
role: "Game Developer"
company: "Solo"
date: April 2024
engine: "Unreal Engine 5"
skills:
  - Movement Design
  - Gameplay programming
  - Unreal blueprints and C++
summary: >
  <p>This is a project I started to improve both my c++ and blueprint skills. This involved researching and analysing 
  how source games (TF2 + CSGO) and Apex Legends handled their movements, and translating those mechanics into Unreal. 
  Inevitably, making a mix of both. In this project, I was able to recreate the bunny hopping and air strafing from source 
  games and mixed it with the wall running and wall climbing from Apex Legends or Titanfall to create a smooth FPS locomotion system.

  <p>After getting movement working, I also implemented the basics of UEâ€™s Gameplay Ability System in order to make weapons 
  and shooting working. I was able to create a system where I had a base weapon that can be populated with a weapon data asset
  that handled the weapons data and shooting mechanics, making the weapons development process modular and easy to do. </p>
