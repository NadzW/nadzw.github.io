summary: >
  <p>My first time putting together and working alongside a small team on a project. This was our take on Brackey's 
  GameJam 2023.2 Theme "Diving Deeper",  playing as a submarine trying to get as low as possible in the deep ocean.
  The goal is to reach a highscore and place as high as possible on the leaderboard.</p>

  <p>This project was the first time I got to work as part of an actual team and helped me improve my communications 
  and give me a chance to create a design document that would be used by others along with helping along with the 
  development of the game in other roles than design. Although the game didn't turn out exactly how we planned (stripped 
  shop power ups and levelling up mechanics due to scope) but i'm very happy with how this game turned out.</p>
responsibilities:
  - Putting team together and maintaining good communication
  - Creating main game design document
  - Game concept, ideation and mechanics
  - Helped with asset creation and some basic programming
