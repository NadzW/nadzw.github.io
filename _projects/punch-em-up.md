summary: >
  <p>This was the first game I ever made to "completion" and published to be played. Made in under 72 hours, following 
  the limitations of only upto 5 colours and the theme power. You play as a street brawler and make your way through a 
  street littered with thugs. No one can stop you from reaching the Thug Leader at the end of the street.</p>

  <p>This project served as my gateway into actually wanting to continue learning game development and eventually 
  game design in more depth. Although it was a buggy mess, I gained confidence in my ability and skill to make great things!</p>
