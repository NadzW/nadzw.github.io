summary: >
  <p>This rhythm-based run-and-gun game was developed as part of a group project over 12 weeks. As one of the designers,
  I contributed to the game's core mechanics, which combined fast-paced side-scrolling action with music-synced inputs 
  that dictated dodges, dashes, and special attacks. The game features a stylized art aesthetic and vertically dynamic movement,
  with levels designed to challenge timing, rhythm, and reflexes in harmony with the soundtrack.</p>
  
  <p>The game was also nominated by lecturers and supervisors to be showcased at the universities end of year game showcase, 
  "Game Over". However due to the teams availabilty, not many of the members could show up to the event, meaning we didn't get to
  present our game.</p>
responsibilities:
  - Working as part of a team
  - Creation of main game design document
  - UI design and asset creation
  - Working with artists to import assets into the game
  - Playtesting and improvements to gameplay
